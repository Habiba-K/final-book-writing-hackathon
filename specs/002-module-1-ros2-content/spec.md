# Feature Specification: Module 1 - ROS 2 Content with Installation and Code Examples

**Feature Branch**: `002-module-1-ros2-content`
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Module 1 ROS 2 Content - 6 comprehensive chapters with installation commands, sample code, and step-by-step tutorials for ROS 2 fundamentals"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - View Chapter with Installation & Code (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to read chapters with ROS 2 installation commands and complete runnable code examples, so I can learn ROS 2 fundamentals and set up my development environment.

**Why this priority**: Core learning content - without chapters students cannot access course material.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to any of 6 chapters, verify content displays with code syntax highlighting and copy buttons functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on Module 1, **When** I click any chapter link, **Then** I see chapter content with formatted code blocks
2. **Given** I am reading a chapter, **When** I find a code example, **Then** I see Python/bash/XML/YAML syntax highlighting
3. **Given** I view a code block, **When** I click copy button, **Then** complete code copies to clipboard
4. **Given** I am on a chapter, **When** I reach bottom, **Then** I see Previous/Next navigation links

---

### User Story 2 - Learn ROS 2 Fundamentals Sequentially (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to progress through 6 chapters in order (architecture → communication → packages → launch → URDF → controllers), so I can build knowledge incrementally.

**Why this priority**: Sequential learning path ensures proper skill building - each chapter builds on previous.

**Independent Test**: Navigate Chapter 1→2→3→4→5→6 using Next links, verify each chapter covers expected topic with code examples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I complete Chapter 1 (architecture), **When** I click Next, **Then** I see Chapter 2 (communication patterns)
2. **Given** I am on Chapter 3 (packages), **When** I click Previous, **Then** I return to Chapter 2
3. **Given** I complete Chapter 6, **When** I click Module 1 link, **Then** I return to Module 1 overview
4. **Given** I am on any chapter, **When** I use sidebar, **Then** I see all 6 chapters listed with current highlighted

---

### User Story 3 - Search Chapter Content (Priority: P2)

As a student, I want to search for specific topics (like "publisher" or "URDF"), so I can quickly find relevant chapter sections.

**Why this priority**: Improves content discoverability but students can browse chapters without search.

**Independent Test**: Use Docusaurus search to find "publisher", "URDF", "launch file" - verify results link to correct chapters.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I type "ROS 2 publisher" in search, **When** results appear, **Then** Chapter 2 appears in results
2. **Given** I search "URDF joints", **When** I click result, **Then** I navigate to Chapter 5 section about joints
3. **Given** I search "colcon build", **When** results show, **Then** Chapter 3 appears with build commands highlighted

### Edge Cases

- What happens when students view code examples on mobile devices? (Horizontal scrolling enabled for wide code blocks)
- How does system handle students skipping directly to advanced chapters? (Prerequisites noted in each chapter intro)
- What if ROS 2 installation commands fail on non-Ubuntu systems? (Ubuntu 22.04 requirement stated with link to official ROS 2 docs for other platforms)
- How do students verify code examples without ROS 2 installed? (All code is complete and ready to run once environment is set up)

## Assumptions

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-06

- Q: The current feature specification (spec.md) explicitly lists "Content for Modules 2, 3, 4" as "Out of Scope". Are you requesting to modify the scope to include these modules, or are you seeking more detailed chapters *within the current Module 1 scope*? → A: Modify scope to include Modules 2, 3, 4

- Students possess basic Python programming knowledge (variables, functions, classes)
- Students can navigate terminal/command line interfaces
- ROS 2 Humble packages are available via official apt repositories
- Students will read chapters in sequential order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6) for optimal learning
- Code examples are illustrative and educational - students may need to adapt for specific robots/use cases
- Docusaurus default features (copy button, syntax highlighting) are sufficient for code presentation
- GitHub Pages deployment workflow from feature 001 is functional and accessible
