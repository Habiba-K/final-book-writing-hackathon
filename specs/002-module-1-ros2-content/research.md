# Research Plan: Module 1-4 ROS 2 Content

**Date**: 2025-12-06

## Research Areas

### 1. Docusaurus Multi-Module Content Structure

**Decision**: Single project structure with content in `book-site/docs/module-X/`
**Rationale**: The `plan.md` specifies a "Single project" structure where Docusaurus generates a static site. Content for each module will reside in `book-site/docs/module-X/` as Markdown files, with Docusaurus configuration in `book-site/` at the repository root. This approach is consistent with Docusaurus best practices for organizing multi-module content within a single instance.
**Alternatives considered**: Multiple Docusaurus instances (rejected due to increased maintenance overhead and deployment complexity).

### 2. ROS 2 and Digital Twin (Gazebo/Unity) Integration Best Practices

**Decision**: Utilize `ros_gz_bridge` for Gazebo integration and Unity's official robotics packages/ROS-TCP-Connector or `ros2-for-unity (R2FU)` for Unity integration.
**Rationale**: For Gazebo, `ros_gz_bridge` provides robust bidirectional communication between ROS 2 and Gazebo topics. For Unity, both Unity's official robotics packages with ROS-TCP-Connector and `ros2-for-unity (R2FU)` offer viable integration paths, with R2FU providing more native, high-performance integration. Both approaches emphasize accurate modeling, sensor emulation, and modular design. The choice between Unity's official packages and R2FU depends on the desired level of native ROS 2 integration and performance requirements. Version compatibility between ROS 2 and Gazebo is a critical consideration.
**Alternatives considered**: Custom message passing implementations (rejected due to higher development effort and maintenance compared to established bridging solutions).

### 3. NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS Integration Best Practices

**Decision**: NEEDS RESEARCH
**Rationale**: Module 3 focuses on NVIDIA Isaac Sim for AI-robot brains, including synthetic data generation and Isaac ROS for perception and VSLAM. Research into official NVIDIA documentation and community best practices is required to ensure accurate and performant integration within the curriculum.
**Alternatives considered**: N/A

### 4. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Pipeline Integration Best Practices

**Decision**: Implement a modular VLA architecture utilizing Whisper for speech-to-text, LLMs for reasoning and task planning, and ROS 2 for action execution. Employ transformer-based sequence models and unified real-world policies.
**Rationale**: A modular design with distinct vision, language, and action components allows for flexibility and scalability. Whisper efficiently handles voice commands, while LLMs provide advanced reasoning and task planning capabilities. ROS 2 offers a robust framework for integrating robotic actions and sensor data. Key challenges include data scarcity, embodiment transfer, computational costs, real-time inference, and ensuring safety. Multi-stage training, leveraging pre-trained models, and effective tokenization are recommended best practices.
**Alternatives considered**: End-to-end VLA models (rejected due to higher complexity in training and debugging, and less modularity compared to distinct components).
