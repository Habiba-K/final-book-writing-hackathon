## Outcome
- Students can build a voice-to-action humanoid system that understands speech, interprets scenes, and performs autonomous tasks in simulation."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Voice Command to Action Execution (Priority: P1)

As a student learning humanoid robotics, I want to give voice commands to a humanoid robot simulation so that it can understand my speech and execute appropriate actions like picking up objects or navigating to locations.

**Why this priority**: This represents the core value proposition of the VLA module - connecting speech input directly to robotic action execution, which is fundamental to the learning objectives.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing voice input to the system and verifying that the robot simulation executes the correct ROS 2 action commands based on the interpreted intent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a humanoid robot simulation is running, **When** a student speaks a command like "Pick up the red cube", **Then** the system transcribes the speech, extracts the intent, and executes the appropriate ROS 2 action to move the robot's arm to pick up the red cube.

2. **Given** a humanoid robot simulation with visual perception capabilities, **When** a student asks "What objects do you see?", **Then** the system processes the question and responds with a list of recognized objects in the scene.

---
### User Story 2 - Multi-Modal Perception Integration (Priority: P2)

As a student learning about multi-modal AI systems, I want to understand how vision and language work together in robotic systems so that I can build robots that can interpret complex scenes and respond to natural language queries about what they perceive.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the multi-modal perception requirement which is essential for scene understanding and forms the foundation for more complex autonomous behaviors.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by presenting visual scenes to the system and verifying that it can correctly identify objects and respond to natural language queries about the scene.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visual scene with multiple objects, **When** a student asks "Where is the blue cylinder?", **Then** the system identifies the location of the blue cylinder in the visual scene and responds appropriately.

---
### User Story 3 - Autonomous Task Sequencing (Priority: P3)

As a student learning about autonomous robotics, I want to create task sequences that combine speech understanding, perception, and action execution so that I can build complete robotic assistants that can handle multi-step commands.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the autonomous task execution learning outcome and provides the capstone integration that connects all components together.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by defining a multi-step task (e.g., "Go to the kitchen, find a cup, and bring it to me") and verifying that the system can execute the sequence with appropriate monitoring and error recovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a multi-step command, **When** the system executes the task sequence, **Then** it monitors progress and can recover from simple errors like not finding an expected object.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when speech recognition fails due to background noise?
- How does the system handle ambiguous language commands?
- What occurs when the vision system cannot identify requested objects?
- How does the system respond to commands that are physically impossible for the robot to execute?
- What happens when the robot loses track of an object during manipulation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST convert speech input to text using Whisper for transcription
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract intent from transcribed speech to determine appropriate robot actions
- **FR-003**: Students MUST be able to map natural language commands to ROS 2 action commands
- **FR-004**: System MUST fuse visual perception with language understanding for scene interpretation
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute autonomous task sequences with progress monitoring
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate all VLA components in a humanoid robot simulation environment

- **FR-008**: System MUST handle error recovery for simple execution failures
- **FR-009**: System MUST demonstrate a complete example such as "Voice command → pick object"

### Key Entities

- **Voice Command**: Natural language input from students that specifies desired robot behavior
- **Transcription**: Text representation of speech input generated by Whisper ASR system
- **Intent**: Extracted meaning from natural language that maps to specific robot actions
- **ROS 2 Action**: Command structure that controls robot behavior in the simulation environment
