# Module 2 — Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on creating high-fidelity digital twins of humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity, integrating physics & sensor simulations, and connecting ROS 2 control pipelines.

## Overview

This module teaches students to:
- Understand digital twin concepts and their applications in humanoid robotics
- Set up and use Gazebo simulation environment
- Configure physics simulation with realistic parameters
- Add and configure sensors (LiDAR, RGB-D, IMU, cameras) in simulation
- Integrate ROS 2 control systems with simulated robots
- Optionally visualize simulations in Unity (for systems with capable GPUs)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- ROS 2 Humble or Iron installed and configured
