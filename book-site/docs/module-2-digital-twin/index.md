# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module teaches students about digital twin concepts, Gazebo simulation basics, Unity integration, ROS-Gazebo-Unity bridge, and digital twin validation with focus on theoretical understanding.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system. In robotics, it allows you to:
- Test algorithms safely in simulation
- Validate sensor data processing
- Develop control strategies without hardware risk
- Experiment with different scenarios

**Key Architecture**: Robot → ROS → Simulator → Unity

## Module Structure

This module is organized into 5 chapters:

1. [Digital Twin Overview](./01-digital-twin-overview/index.md) - Understanding digital twin concepts in robotics
2. [Gazebo Simulation Basics](./02-gazebo-simulation-basics/index.md) - Gazebo fundamentals and simulation concepts
3. [Unity Robotics Integration](./03-unity-robotics-integration/index.md) - Unity visualization and data integration
4. [ROS–Gazebo–Unity Bridge](./04-ros-gazebo-unity-bridge/index.md) - Message flow and communication between components
5. [Digital Twin Validation](./05-digital-twin-validation/index.md) - Synchronization and validation techniques

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will understand:
- What a digital twin is and its role in robotics
