# Assessment Rubric Template for Chapter Exercises

This document provides a standardized template for assessing chapter exercises in the Digital Twin module. The rubric ensures consistent evaluation criteria across all chapters and provides clear feedback to students.

## General Assessment Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
Each chapter exercise will be assessed based on the following criteria:

1. **Understanding (30%)** - Demonstrates comprehension of core concepts
2. **Implementation (30%)** - Correctly applies learned concepts
3. **Analysis (20%)** - Analyzes and interprets results
4. **Documentation (20%)** - Properly documents process and findings

### Scoring Scale
- **Excellent (4)**: Exceeds expectations, shows deep understanding
- **Proficient (3)**: Meets expectations, demonstrates solid understanding
- **Developing (2)**: Approaches expectations, shows basic understanding
- **Beginning (1)**: Below expectations, needs significant improvement
- **Not Attempted (0)**: Exercise not completed
