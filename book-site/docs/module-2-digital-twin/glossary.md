# Glossary: Digital Twin Concepts

## A

**Architecture** - The structural design of a digital twin system, typically following the Robot → ROS → Simulator → Unity pattern.

## B

**Bridge System** - The communication layer enabling message flow between ROS, Gazebo, and Unity components.

## D

**Digital Twin** - A virtual representation of a physical robot system that connects Robot → ROS → Simulator → Unity, allowing safe testing and validation.

## G

**Gazebo** - A physics-based robot simulation environment that provides realistic physics simulation, sensor simulation, and integration with ROS 2.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** - A sensor that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

## R

**Robot Operating System (ROS)** - A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

**ROS 2** - The second generation of the Robot Operating System with improved features for real-world applications.

## S

**Sensor Simulation** - The process of creating virtual sensors in simulation that mimic real-world sensor behavior.

**Simulation Pipeline** - The data flow system connecting ROS, Gazebo, and Unity components in a digital twin architecture.

**Synchronization** - The process of maintaining consistent state across all components of a digital twin system.

## U

**Unity** - A real-time 3D development platform used for advanced visualization of robot behavior and sensor data in digital twin systems.

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** - An XML format for representing a robot model including kinematic and dynamic properties.

## V

**Validation** - The process of ensuring that a digital twin system maintains integrity by synchronizing physics, transforms, and robots across all components.

## S

**SDF (Simulation Description Format)** - An XML format for describing objects and environments in simulation, used by Gazebo.
