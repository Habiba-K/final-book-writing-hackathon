# Learning Objectives: Gazebo Simulation Basics

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:

## Core Knowledge
1. **Define Gazebo Simulation** - Students will be able to clearly articulate what Gazebo is in the context of robotics simulation and distinguish it from other simulation platforms.

2. **Identify Supported Models and Sensors** - Students will recognize the types of robot models and sensors that Gazebo supports and explain their applications in simulation.

3. **Explain URDF/SDF Import Process** - Students will understand how to import robot models in URDF and SDF formats into Gazebo and the differences between these formats.

## Functional Understanding
4. **Describe ROS 2 Integration** - Students will explain how Gazebo connects to ROS 2 topics and services for communication with other system components.

5. **Perform Basic Operations** - Students will execute basic Gazebo commands using text-only interfaces to launch worlds and spawn robot models.

6. **Troubleshoot Common Issues** - Students will identify and resolve common problems that occur when setting up Gazebo simulations.

## Application Skills
7. **Apply Simulation Concepts** - Students will demonstrate understanding by explaining how to set up a basic simulation environment with a robot model.

8. **Validate Simulation Setup** - Students will verify that a Gazebo simulation is properly configured and communicating with ROS 2.

## Assessment Criteria

Students will demonstrate mastery by:
- Accurately describing Gazebo's role in the digital twin architecture
- Executing text-only commands to perform basic Gazebo operations
- Explaining the relationship between URDF/SDF models and Gazebo simulation
- Identifying potential issues and their solutions in simulation setup
